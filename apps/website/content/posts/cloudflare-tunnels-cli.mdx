These commands should get you started with creating and managing Cloudflare tunnels from the command line:

# Install cloudflared CLI tool
brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared

# Login to Cloudflare
cloudflared tunnel login

# Create a new tunnel
cloudflared tunnel create <tunnel-name>

# List existing tunnels
cloudflared tunnel list

# Delete a tunnel
cloudflared tunnel delete <tunnel-id>

# Route traffic to your tunnel
cloudflared tunnel route dns <tunnel-name> <hostname>

# Run a tunnel locally
cloudflared tunnel run <tunnel-name>

# Configure a tunnel with a config file
cloudflared tunnel --config config.yml run <tunnel-name>

# Example config file (config.yml):
# tunnel: <tunnel-id>
# credentials-file: /path/to/credentials.json
# ingress:
#   - hostname: example.com
#     service: http://localhost:3000
#   - service: http_status:404
```

These basic commands cover the essentials for creating and managing Cloudflare tunnels through the command line interface.
