# First Night With Baby Alone

Tonight marks a significant milestone - the first night alone with our newborn while my wife gets some much-needed rest at her mother's place. I'm equal parts excited and terrified.

## The Setup

I've prepared everything I could think of:
- 6 bottles pre-filled with formula
- Changing station fully stocked
- White noise machine on standby
- Bassinet next to my desk (so I can still troubleshoot server issues between feedings)

## The First Few Hours

7:00 PM - Baby's asleep. I set up my laptop to fix some broken CI/CD pipelines.

9:30 PM - First feeding went smoothly! Baby burped like a champ.

11:45 PM - Second feeding. Diaper change became a mini-disaster when I realized I put it on backwards initially. Apparently, programming is easier than diapering.

## The Middle of the Night

2:30 AM - The NixOS rebuild I started finished just in time for the third feeding. Multi-tasking!

4:15 AM - Baby wanted to have a philosophical conversation about containers vs VMs at this hour. I obliged.

## Lessons Learned

- Sleep when the baby sleeps is not compatible with maintaining servers
- The first rule of parenthood is the same as programming: when something works, don't touch it
- My terminal's night mode is much appreciated during 3 AM feedings

<Tip>
Keep a water bottle and snacks within arm's reach at all times.

In the morning, everything felt worth it when I got those tiny smiles. Parenthood might be the most challenging distributed system I've ever had to manage, but it's definitely the most rewarding.
